# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for macOS

### Installation

1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:austenc/dotfiles.git ~/Code/dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/Code/dotfiles` **these dotfiles assume they're in that folder**
2. Run `./setup.zsh`
3. Restart any terminals, run `p10k configure` and install the suggested font.

Enjoy! ✌️
